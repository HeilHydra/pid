Responsibilities will be shared as there are only three people in the team. The roles will be changing as the project progresses are some team members are stronger in different phases of the project. In the RAD Development phase for example, Oliver will be taking on the PM role as within the team he has the most expertise in terms of development and how to better organise the team. Jay will be assisting Oliver at this stage. Simon will be handing the business model of the project and liasioning with Atos when necessary.
