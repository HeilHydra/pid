\section{Project Management}

In terms of work organisation, all members of the team are working according to their strengths. This ensures all work is done in the most efficient manner. Meetings are very frequent within the team and all members contribute a number of hours every week towards the module. For each meeting, tasks are set for the following week and completed tasks are reviewed for the last week. This ensures everyone is on the same page and there is no duplication of work. All members can also manage their time more effectively if tasks are decided and assigned beforehand.

Communication between the team takes place on a WhatsApp group and a Facebook group. This is where all meetings times and locations are decided and any changes or input that needs to be addressed before the next review meeting. 

All of the work is managed online via a Github project where all team members commit changes to necessary parts of the project. There is also a shared Google Drive between the members which will be used to share files between the members. Using online repositories here will avoid any loss of data.
